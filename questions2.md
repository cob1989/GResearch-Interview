Process

First, familiarize yourself with the Communication Guides. It details what can/should be said in interviews. Also have a look at interview process.pptx

Phone screen

The phone screen takes approximately one hour.  If the candidate is very far from your expectations, just stop ASAP.

2mins  Introduction  Introduce yourself and explain briefly that you'll not discuss the candidate experience at that stage.

Mention the phone interview will be a series of rapid fire questions followed by a coding test and should take no more than an hour

10-30mins  Q & A  Ask questions from Phone screen interview questions. Please highlight the questions you ask, mark them with good or bad, and note anything that is particularly interesting (whether good or bad)

20mins  Coding Test  Coding question - Recommendation is to use hacker rank code pair which we get included in our subscription https://www.hackerrank.com/x/interviews/mypads

We've historically also used collabedit.com If you use collabedit, write down the code at the end of the url on your notes before leaving the interview.

5mins  Candidate Q  Give the candidate the opportunity to ask a few question and tell him that HR will get in touch with him ASAP

On-Site Technical Interview

If the candidate has performed well enough they will be invited in for an on-site technical interview.  The process for this is as follows:

Design Interview (75 minutes)

An exercise focused on having the candidate come up with an architecture/tradeoffs for a system. No code is expected

Before the design interview, prepare one of the questions from the phone screen which the candidate did not answer well.  In addition prepare a question that they did answer that is related.

10mins  Introduction

Introduce yourself, describe the role.

During this stage, ask the question they answered already, followed by the question they did not answer well.

The goal here is to measure the curiousity of the candidate, but not to be defensive right from the start.

60mins  Exercise  One questions from the approved [Design] list.

5 mins  Candidate Q  Ask the candidate if they have any questions

Coding Simulation (75 minutes)

The coding simulation exercise puts the candidate in a room with a sandboxed environment and a fairly simple coding problem to work through.

Before this stage of the interview starts, follow the instructions from [Coding] Bookshop Problem - Before the candidate arrives.  Details of our current test is also presented on that page.

5mins  Introduction  Introduce yourself and describe the problem they are looking to solve.

60mins  Exercise (little intervention)  Ask the candidate to start working. Remain in the room for a few minutes until you are happy the candidate has settled

Return after half an hour and check they're all OK or if they have any other questions.

10mins  Debrief  Return and ask the candidate to talk you through their solution, what they achieved and what they would have like to have achieved if they'd had more time.

If the candidate is going through to the next stage, then let them know someone will be through shortly for the next test

5mins  Rejection only:

Candidate Q  If the candidate has not met requirements either in design or in coding simulation, ask if they have any questions at this stage,

Coding Algo Test (60 minutes)

A 1h interview that explores ability of the candidate to work through some standard algorithmic based problems, writing code on paper for these.

5mins  Introduction  Introduce yourself

50mins  Exercises  Two coding questions from the approved [Coding] list

5mins  Candidate Q  Ask the candidate if they have any questions

Management interview

-  A 1h discussion with the manager, mostly focussed on soft skills and motivation. Management interview questions

-  senior management interview(s) - Stephen, Chris and Ben's stuff 

Writing a report

-  Please use this email template for the video: Video Interview Feedback and this file for on-site: On-site Interview Feedback

-  Report should be written in the next 24h. After that point you start to forget the details
